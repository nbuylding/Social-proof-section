## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to stagger various containers so they aren't aligned with one another (on purpose). 


### Continued development

The biggest thing I need to work on is looking up code snippets and other ways to solve any issues I run into.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped to remind me how to use certain CSS tools, specifically the shorthands for padding and margins.
- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped to remind me of the value placement for the margin and padding shorthands.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me to center a container without using flexbox by default.
